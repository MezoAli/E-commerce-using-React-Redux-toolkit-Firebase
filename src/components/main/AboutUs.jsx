				Establish a mission statement.
			</h2>
			<p>
				Your About page can and will be more comprehensive than a single mission
				statement, but to draw people in, you need to succinctly state your goal
				in the industry upfront. What is your business here to do? Why should
				your website visitors care? This information will give the reader
				something to remember about your company long after they leave your
				website.
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-capitalize text-center my-5">
				Outline your company story.
			</h2>
			<p>
				Every business has a story to tell. Even if you're running a start-up,
				you might not have a long history of changes and growth (yet), but it's
				a nice touch to talk about how you got to where you are on the About
				page. So, isolate the milestones before your company's founding, and use
				them to give readers some backstory on your current venture.
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-capitalize text-center my-5">
				Reveal how you've evolved.
			</h2>
			<p>
				There's no shame in admitting how your business strategy — or even your
				way of thinking — has changed since you began. In fact, these evolutions
				can improve the story you tell to website visitors. About pages are
				perfect spaces to talk about where you started, how you've grown, and
				the ideals that have helped your organization mature. Use these moments
				to further your company story and show people that you're always ready
				to change and adapt to the needs of your industry.
